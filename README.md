As I start my programming journey with Java at SoftUni, I’m diving into the basics and fundamentals through projects and tasks that strengthen my understanding of the language. 
From learning variables, loops, and conditionals to exploring object-oriented programming, each project is a stepping stone in my development.
I've already shared these projects and tasks on GitHub, so you can explore my progress and see the work I’ve completed so far.
